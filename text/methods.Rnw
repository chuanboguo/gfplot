\section{METHODS}

\subsection{OVERARCHING COMMENTS}

The various plots are placed randomly on the page for now (whatever I could get
to fit in LaTeX). I didn't want to spend time carefully laying them out and
arranging them until we decide exactly what we are including. For now, I am
showing plots for all the ``commercially valuable assessment species'' and half
of the ``candidate species for triage assessments'' as listed at the end of the
current Groundfish Strategic Plan (Draft 3). This is just for demonstration
purposes. We also need to decide which stocks to include.

I imagine we will also have some text at the top for each stock that gives
information such as the scientific name, last assessment if available, perhaps
something about the management scheme, and any other notes of interest for that
stock.

The colour schemes for the four main synoptic surveys are consistent throughout
the various plots to help guide the eye and make it easier to quickly connect
the various pieces.

There's a tension between plotting what is best for a given stock vs.\ making
the exact same plots for all the stocks regardless of if there are data for
a given stock. I think there is value in showing the exact same plots and panels
for every single stock so that you can quickly browse through multiple stocks
and no where to look. It also makes it easy to quickly get a feeling for how
data limited a stock is by the missing data plots.

All maps are shown in UTMs (zone 8) so that distance is constant. This is
important for the spatial modeling. Perhaps this would be better as zone 9 as
I see has been used for some coast-wide analyses before. I have not added axes
to the map plots in an attempt to simplify, but I could add those.

Some of the SQL data queries are modified from Norm's existing code in GFASTeR.
I've included the SQL code at this stage for full transparency and so others can
check the data query, but ultimately I imagine this would be summarized in the
research document.

I'm assuming we won't include captions for every single plot on every single
page (there would be a fully explained template at the beginning and a research
document accompanying the first year of publication to fill in more details).
However, it might be useful to have labels on each plot/panel to help people
remember the basics of what each plot indicates.

If we include much more (and even now) we might need two pages per stock.

\textit{Other possible plots:}

Do we want to show effort through time at least for recent years?

Do we want to show length or age plotted against maturity? This could include
a model fit similarly to the length-age and length-weight panels. 

Are there other plots that people would find useful to include?

\subsection{COMMERCIAL FISHERY CATCHES}

I extracted commercial fishery landings and discards from the GFFOS
\texttt{GF\_MERGED\_CATCH} table.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2.75in]{../catches/pacific-ocean-perch.pdf}
\caption{Pacific Ocean Perch catches.}
\end{figure}

\verbatiminput{../R/get-landings.sql}

The plot shows the sum of landings (weight of landings plus weight of discards)
aggregated each year within bottom trawl, midwater trawl, hook and line, and
trap categories. I aggregated other minor categories, including \texttt{unknown}
and generic \texttt{trawl} into their own category. These generally represent
a very small quantity of catches. I combined discarded weight across all the
categories. I did not include fish pieces in the current plot, which for the
most part means that hook and line discards are ignored.

Years before 1996 are shaded to indicate they are less reliable.

Do we want to try and account for hook and line discards? Do we want to show
trawl and hook and line / traps separately?

\subsection{COMMERCIAL CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3.8in]{../cpue/pacific-ocean-perch.pdf}
\caption{Pacific Ocean Perch CPUE for the groundfish bottom trawl sector. Shown
  is the geometric mean within each hexagon cell since 2013.}
\end{figure}

The data are extracted from GFFOS with the following code:

\verbatiminput{../R/get-cpue.sql}

These represent catches in weight (landings + discards) per unit effort (time) for the
groundfish trawl fleet.

The plots show all CPUE from 2013 onwards since the trawl footprint was frozen
in April 2012.

Hexagon cells are 7 km wide and show the geometric mean of CPUE as indicated by
the shading of each cell. Cells must have at least three unique vessels to be
shown. I am also only showing any data if there are at least 5 hexagon cells to
show.

The map shows depth contours at 100m, 200m, and 500m (in increasingly slightly
darker shades of grey).

The coloured rectangles indicate the subplot regions in the spatial survey plots.

We may want to show the trawl footprint boundaries.

Do we also want to show hook and line CPUE?

We could pick a finer or coarser cell size. I picked something to approximately
match what is usually used in groundfish stock assessment research documents.
It's a balance between fine-scale accuracy and being able to see the patterns on
a relatively small figure.

We could possibly show this at a couple slices of time. Including, perhaps,
a slice of time before the footprint was frozen.

\subsection{AVAILABLE BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES} \label{sec:bio-samples}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2.45in]{../synop/dat-syn-pacific-ocean-perch.pdf}
\caption{Pacific Ocean Perch available biological samples.}
\end{figure}

I extracted data for the survey samples from GFBioSQL with:

\verbatiminput{../R/get-survey-biology.sql}

I then removed duplicate specimen IDs in R since these can be duplicated across
multiple survey groupings (and my R skills greatly exceed my SQL skills!).
                                                   
I extracted data for the commercial samples from GFBioSQL with:

\verbatiminput{../R/get-commercial-biology.sql}

The shading of the grid cells indicates the number of samples for a given year
and data type available across all surveys or commercial sources. The cell in
each panel with the largest value has its value indicated in text (rounded to an
appropriate clean number). The color scales are independent between the
commercial and survey panels.

For the commercial samples, I am only showing unsorted samples. We could include
sorted samples or include them as a separate panel or rows for some types of
data.

Note that the survey samples come from all survey data in the GFBioSQL
database, not just the surveys focused on elsewhere in the document.

I'm currently only counting specimens which have a \texttt{sex} value of male or
female. I'm not sure if there are some stocks where it is difficult to assign
a sex but we do still want the biological measurements.

We could also consider showing the counts for male and female, or for female
only, which might make sense for the purposes of data-limited assessments that
do not model the two separately.

\subsection{LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../joy/pacific-ocean-perch-joy.pdf}
\caption{Pacific Ocean Perch length distributions shown as probability densities
  of ``Joy'' plots.. Coloured represents females. Grey represents males.}
\end{figure}

Uses the same SQL query as for Section \ref{sec:bio-samples}.

These are probability density plots for the fish lengths by year and survey.
Effectively these are a continuous version of a histogram. 

Coloured represents females. Grey represents males. I've been trying to figure
out what the best way to indicate that on the plot is.

The plots are only showing probability densities for year-sex-survey
combinations with at least 20 fish samples. Otherwise, the probability density
plots can start reflecting more noise than signal in the data.

These could be done instead as histograms or as bubble plots, but it is
challenging to fit as much information in such a small space with these other
types of plots.

\subsection{SPATIAL MODELLING OF SYNOPTIC TRAWL SURVEY DATA}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../spatial-survey/pacific-ocean-perch.pdf}
\caption{Pacific Ocean Perch biomass estimates from surveys.}
\end{figure}

The data were extracted from GFBioSQL with the procedure
\texttt{proc\_catmat\_2011}, which is used to generate the data for the usual
stratum-based bootstrap procedure to calculate the biomass indices from these
trawl surveys.

Here I am fitting Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects models with Gaussian
random fields to estimate expected biomass density on the surface covering the
entirety of the survey boundaries. I fit the models with the glmmfields
R package I've been working on
(\url{https://github.com/seananderson/glmmfields}). The Gaussian
random field describes a wiggly surface of unexplained spatial pattern (the
``random effects'') in the response variable (here biomass of fish or
probability of observing a given fish species in a survey tow) beyond that which
can be described by the included ("fixed effect") predictors (here a quadratic
effect of bottom depth). Gaussian random fields describe random effects drawn
from a multivariate normal distribution with some estimated covariance
structure. The glmmfields package uses a predictive process approach where
a limited number of ``knots'' are modelled and these are projected to the data
locations as part of the fitting process. This makes the analysis of large
spatial data sets possible.

See Appendix \ref{sec:spatial-app} for details on the methods.

At this point I'm only using bottom depth as a predictor but there's no reason
why we couldn't include other predictors such as bottom temperature and
substrate type. 

I still need to tweak the interpolation algorithm to go from the
bathymetry grid layer to the locations of the grid cells in the final
projection (I think it's introducing a bit of `roughness' right now). I'm using
actual tow depth for the observed data and the depth data from `PBSdata::bctopo`
for the projections. Originally I was using a NOAA dataset, but it didn't match
the trawl depths as closely. It sounds like another division of DFO might be
developing an even better version we could use.

There are separate models for the presence or absence of a given species in
a tow and for the density if they are observed. These are then combined after by
multiplying the probability of observation with the density conditional on being
observed and are projected onto a fine-scale grid encompassing the full region
of the survey polygon.

I am only fitting the spatial models if at least 10\% of the survey tows from
a given survey caught that species that year. Otherwise, there is very little
data to estimate the positive density component. In these cases, I just show the
raw tow data and do not add the colour shading for the predicted biomass density.

I am only showing the predicted biomass density for fine-scale grid cells within
the range of depth for that survey in that year (extending an extra 5m shallower
and deeper; hence the patches of white). This avoids extrapolating the
density-presence and density-biomass relationships. This becomes important
because there are a couple points in the survey polygons that get very close to
land, even crossing slightly. Extrapolating the quadratic relationship can
predict very high densities for these grid cells and distort the colour
scheme.

Crosses indicate tows that did not catch that species. Circles indicate tows
that did catch that species and the area of the circle is proportional to the
density.

We may want to add point size and colour legends to these. We may also want to
scale the colours and point sizes so that they are consistent across the
different survey panels. Right now there is no way to get a feeling for the
relative abundance of species between the survey areas. The only larger scale
spatial indicator is the trawl CPUE.

We would want to emphasize that these spatial predictions are for visualization
purposes only at this point. We'd want to do a lot more investigation on
a stock-by-stock basis before believing them too strongly.

\subsection{BIOMASS SURVEY INDEX TRENDS}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3.4in]{../sparks/pacific-ocean-perch.pdf}
\caption{Pacific Ocean Perch survey biomass index trends.}
\end{figure}

Extracted with:

\verbatiminput{../R/get-survey-boot.sql}

from GFBioSQL.

These show the median and 95\% bootstrap confidence intervals on the survey
biomass trends through time. Each trend is scaled so that the maximum upper
confidence interval reaches the top of the plot. We could consider plotting them
with consistent absolute biomass on the y-axis, but that depends how much we
trust these values relative to each other.

We will almost certainly not want to show all the cases where data are present,
which is what I am currently doing. We will have to make some decisions about
which surveys are likely representative on various species and somehow indicate
if we have not shown a given survey trend (it may be by shading that panel
grey.).

There are also other possible surveys to show. It's a balance of finding the
surveys that are indicative for the most stocks and I welcome thoughts on this.

\subsection{LENGTH-AGE AND LENGTH-WEIGHT MODEL FITS}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3.35in]{../vb/pacific-ocean-perch.pdf}
\caption{Pacific Ocean Perch length-age and length-weight model fits.}
\end{figure}

This is using the same data extracted for Section \ref{sec:bio-samples}.

I am fitting these models to survey data only currently. I should likely include
commercial samples as well. At least the unsorted samples.

I only fit models in cases where there were more than 100 fish samples for
a given species-sex combination.

The von Bertalanffy models were fit with Stan (details to follow):

\begin{equation}
  L_i \sim \mathrm{lognormal} \left( \log(l_\mathrm{inf} (1 - \exp(-k (A_i - t_0)))), \sigma \right)
\end{equation}

where $L_i$ and $A_i$ represent the length and age of fish $i$,
$l_\mathrm{inf}$, $k$, and $t_0$ represent the von Bertalanffy growth
parameters, and $\sigma$ represents the log standard deviation or scale
parameter. The models were fit with the following priors:

\begin{align}
  k &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)[0, \infty]\\
  l_\mathrm{inf} &\sim  \mathcal{N}(0, \varphi)[0, \infty]\\
  \sigma &\sim  \mathcal{N}(0, 1)[0, \infty]\\
  t0 &\sim  \mathcal{N}(0, 20)
\end{align}

where $\varphi$ was set to twice the 99\% quantile of observed lengths for that
stock. This ensures that the $l_\mathrm{inf}$ prior is on an appropriate scale
for a given stock.

These weakly informative priors and the Bayesian framework in general are
helpful when fitting these nonlinear models to a large number of stocks where
maximum likelihood methods can give nonsensical results for some stocks and it
is difficult to adjust the optimization procedure on a stock-by-stock basis. I'm
open to modifying the priors, are trying the same models in TMB. Straight
optimization to the mode of the posterior distributions (i.e.\ no MCMC) in Stan
was having problems for some stocks.

I fit the length-weight models as robust linear regressions of log(length)
on log(weight) (details to follow, \texttt{MASS::rlm()} function).

We may want some filtering iteration where we exclude data points that are
obviously measurement or data-entry errors based on enormous residual values.
This could remove the need for the \textit{robust} linear regression.

All the points are the same colour right now. We could colour them by male and
female. If there are more than 2000 fish samples for a given stock, I randomly
sample 2000 fish to plot. This is just to avoid plotting an excessive number of
dots, which generates very large PDF files.

\subsection{AGE BUBBLE PLOTS}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in]{../bubbles/pacific-ocean-perch.pdf}
\caption{Pacific Ocean Perch age bubble plots.}
\end{figure}

This is using the same data extracted for Section \ref{sec:bio-samples}.

The area of the circles is proportional to the number of fish at a given age in
a given year for a given survey. The bubble scale is constant for a given
stock but is independent across stocks so that the maximum area of a bubble
is the same across stocks. We could instead scale them within each survey.

This, and the length plots, are cases where we may want to select a certain
number of surveys that have the most data for a given stock since there are
cases where these four synoptic surveys are not the best available data for
a given stock.

It looks like our CSAS reports usually have length or age on the y axis and year
on the x axis. The current plots are reversed from this. I was trying to keep
the same orientation as the length distribution plots. This could be changed.
