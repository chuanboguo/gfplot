# Meeting objectives

Review and confirm agreement with the semi-final project charter.

Ensure everyone has an up-to-date understanding of the current project status focussing mainly on the synopsis report.

Discuss a number of outstanding issues and make decisions as a group where possible.

# Synopsis issues to discuss:

## Age/lengths

1. age/lengths for unsorted commercial?
1. which surveys for ages and lengths?
1. male/female for ages/lengths? scaling within whole year?
1. length/age frequency weighting algorithm
1. show aging reliability?

## Effort and commercial CPUE

1. effort: yes or no? trawl and hook and line?
1. CPUE: yes or no? what spatial regions? standardized and raw? requires agreement on filtering
1. effort measurement for CPUE hook and line map: fishing events?

## Growth and maturity

1. unsorted commercial and survey combined for growth, weight, and maturity?
1. maturity model? logistic/double-normal? binomial error or NLS to proportions?
1. maturity for both sexes?

## Biomass index trends 

1. which surveys for biomass indices?
1. how to visualize survey reliability?
1. any indication of relative biomass across spatial regions?

## Descriptive text

Current plan:

1. last research document and SAR (BibTeX citation)
1. taxonomic information (using taxize package)
1. TAC/management scheme
1. any special notes about the data quality for the stock
1. status with COSEWIC/SARA if any
1. rebuilding plan/conservation measures
1. your idea here

# Help wanted

1. double check proportion weighting code
1. guide through technical working group formation
1. TAC, management, rebuilding dataset?
1. local reference databases of Res Docs / SARs?
1. look over CPUE delta formula if showing CPUE / including model in package
