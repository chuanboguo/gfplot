# Meeting objectives

Review and confirm agreement with the semi-final project charter.

Ensure everyone has an up-to-date understanding of the current status of the project focussing mainly on synopsis report.

Discuss a number of outstanding issues and make decisions as a group where possible.

# Synopsis issues to discuss:

1. which surveys for ages and lengths?
1. CPUE: yes or no? what spatial regions? standardized and raw?
1. effort: yes or no? trawl and hook and line?
1. male/female for ages/lengths? what about colours? scaling within sex or whole year?
1. length/age frequency weighting algorithm
1. maturity model? logistic/double-normal? binomial error or NLS to proportions?
1. maturity for both sexes?
1. unsorted commercial and survey combined for growth, weight, and maturity?
1. effort measurement for CPUE hook and line map: effective skate?
1. any indication of relative biomass across spatial regions?
1. show aging reliability?
1. how to visualize survey reliability?
1. which surveys for biomass indices?
1. age/lengths for unsorted commercial?
1. what to include with description at top?

## Description options

- last research document and SAR (BibTeX citation)
- taxonomic information (using taxize package)
- TAC/management scheme
- any special notes about the data quality for the stock
- status with COSEWIC/SARA if any
- rebuilding plan/conservation measures
- your idea here

## Need help

1. double check proportion weighting
2. guide through technical working group formation
3. TAC dataset?
